# pytest-split durations

This directory contains test durations as they were computed by pytest-split
running from GitHub Actions.

They should occasionally be replaced so that the split remains optimal.
(Tests that are missing from this list will be assigned the average duration.)

For more details, see the
[pytest-split documentation](https://jerry-git.github.io/pytest-split/).
