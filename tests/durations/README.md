# pytest-split durations

This directory contains test durations as they were computed by pytest-split
running from GitHub Actions.

They should occasionally be replaced so that the split remains optimal.
(Tests that are missing from this list will be assigned the average duration.)

The JSON files are generated during the pytest runs on GitHub.
They are aggregated in the "Aggregate test durations" job, and available for download as the `aggregated-test-durations` artifact.

For more details, see the
[pytest-split documentation](https://jerry-git.github.io/pytest-split/).
